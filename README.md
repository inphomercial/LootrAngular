## LOOTr!  v0.21 ##

http://inphomercial.github.io/Lootr/

* LOOTr is a work in progress javascript text rpg.

* Initially set out with the desire to have a simple totally randomized game with everything being determined by a multitude of rolltables.

* Tried to create a system that allows for unlimited items, treasures, monsters, etc to be implemented by adding to the /js/roll_tables/ files.

* It is in the process of being converted into an Entity / Component type system. There is still a lot of old code laying around.
